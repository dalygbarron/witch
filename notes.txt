screen is 16 32x32 tiles wide and 14 tall. That means we can have levels that
are 4 screens wide and a little over 2 tall without having to do any spicy
stuff. Frankly, for the style of game I am trying to make, I think that is
perfectly acceptable.

ok so to write to oam we set the table select bit in $2103 because there is the
big table where every sprite has 2 bytes, and the small table where each sprite
has 2 bits. Before that we just set the write address at $2102. As far as I can
tell writing to the large table obviously requires 2 successive writes, but I
think you can just do one write to the small table thankfully.

Ok I think I have an issue where the sprite buffer is being put somewhere that
overlaps with other stuff and is maybe in the ROM I dunno. Anyway I need to fix
that.
